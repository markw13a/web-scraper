Aim of this program is to make it easier for non-EU citizens to find jobs that could potentially sponsor them for a tier 2 visa in the UK. 

TO DO:

>Find alternative to proxy website for bypassing CORS restrictions. Currently using allorigins as a mirror, and it's a serious performance bottleneck.

>Implement list of companies able to sponsor visas into a database accessible to the webpage. Thinking about using SQLite for this as it's my first database project.

>Finish function for auto-generating HTML to display each job posting.

>Add function to check database for given company name. This might be tricky if companies are known by different names in different places.
